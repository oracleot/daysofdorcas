         </div> 
<section> 
<p>Arts is one of the four pillars of GTBank’s Corporate Social Responsibility policy and the launch of Art635 is the latest of the Bank’s sustained efforts to promote African arts locally and internationally. At the moment, most budding indigenous artists in Nigeria and across Africa have little or nowhere to showcase their works and make a living from them.
</p>
<p>With Art635, the bank aims to further its support for African arts by helping African artworks become not just more visible and appreciated, but also to turn them into a much more profitable and commercially viable venture for indigenous artists. 
</p>

<p>
This is in line with the Bank’s initiative to go beyond the traditional understanding of Corporate Social Responsibility as corporate philanthropy by intervening in economic sectors, to strengthen small businesses through capacity building initiatives that serve to boost their expertise, exposure and business growth.
